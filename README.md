    <td>Principle of topology</td>
    <td>
      The algorithm in question applies to a unidirectional ring.<br>
      Each node can send messages to its neighbor in the direction
      hands of a clock. Each node has an ID.<br>
      The objective of this algorithm is to elect the node with the biggest
      identifier (but who does not know it at first.). This node will be
      considered the leader.
